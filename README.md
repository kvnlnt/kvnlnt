 👋

Here's my [past](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlint/) and here's my future: I've become quite passionate (obsessed) about building web
applications that are as beautiful on the inside as they are on the outside. Apps that are: secure, standards compliant, visually stunning, have a great DX and can stand the test of time. I'll let you know when I'm finished.

- ⏰ I’m currently open for work, reach out to me on [LI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlint/) or [my website](http://kevinlint.com)
- 🍩 I’m developing a layer-one javascript framework called [oem](http://github.com/linttrapmedia/oem)
- ⚡️ I'm also developing an htmx-like library called [domx](http://github.com/linttrapmedia/domx)
