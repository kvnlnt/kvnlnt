 👋

Here's my [past](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlint/) and here's my future: I've become quite passionate (obsessed) about building web
applications that are as beautiful on the inside as they are on the outside. Apps that are: secure, standards compliant, visually stunning, have a great DX and can stand the test of time. I'll let you know when I'm finished.

- ⏰ I’m working in private equity real estate at [concreit](http://concreit.com)
- 🎈 I'm experimenting with Frontend-end architectures
- 🍩 I’m looking to collaborate on [oem](http://github.com/lintttrapmedia/oem)
